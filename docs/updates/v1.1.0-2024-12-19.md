# MetroBNB Frontend Update v1.1.0 - December 19, 2024

## 🚀 Major Features

### 📋 Invoice Status Tracking
- **Booking Invoice Status**: Added `invoiced` and `invoiceDate` fields to track which bookings have been invoiced
- **Expense Payment Status**: Added `paid` and `paidDate` fields to track expense payments
- **Smart Filtering**: Invoices now only include uninvoiced bookings and unpaid expenses

### 📅 Airbnb-Style Invoice Logic
- **Check-out Date Filtering**: Invoice generation now uses check-out date (endDate) instead of check-in date
- **Industry Standard**: Follows Airbnb's approach for revenue recognition
- **No Double Counting**: Each booking appears in exactly one invoice period

### 🔔 Unified Notification System
- **useNotify() Composable**: Simplified toast notifications with `notifySuccess()`, `notifyError()`, `notifyInfo()`
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: All API operations now provide user feedback
- **Error Visibility**: Clear error messages for failed operations

### 🎯 Advanced Filtering
- **Booking Filters**: Partner, Unit, Date Range, Payment Status, Invoice Status
- **Expense Filters**: Partner, Unit, Date Range, Type, Payment Status
- **Collapsible UI**: Clean interface with expandable advanced filters

## 📊 Invoice Generation Logic

### Business Rules
```javascript
// Bookings: Include if check-out date falls within invoice period
endDate >= invoiceStart AND endDate <= invoiceEnd AND invoiced = false

// Expenses: Include if date falls within period and unpaid
date >= invoiceStart AND date <= invoiceEnd AND billable = true AND paid = false
```

### Examples
**July 2024 Invoice includes:**
- ✅ June 30 - July 2 booking (checks out July 2)
- ✅ July 15 - July 20 booking (checks out July 20)
- ❌ July 29 - Aug 2 booking (checks out Aug 2)

## 🛠️ Technical Updates

### New Interfaces
```typescript
interface Booking {
  // ... existing fields
  invoiced: boolean         // Invoice status
  invoiceDate: string | null  // Invoice generation date
}

interface Expense {
  // ... existing fields
  paid: boolean            // Payment status
  paidDate: string | null  // Payment date
}
```

### API Enhancements
```typescript
// New filter parameters
GET /api/bookings?invoiced=false
GET /api/expenses?paid=false

// Update operations
PUT /api/bookings/{id} { invoiced: true, invoiceDate: "2024-12-19" }
PUT /api/expenses/{id} { paid: true, paidDate: "2024-12-19" }
```

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Status Indicators
- **Invoice Status**: Green "Invoiced" / Gray "Not Invoiced" badges
- **Payment Status**: Green "Paid" / Red "Unpaid" badges
- **Visual Consistency**: Color-coded status across all pages

### Form Enhancements
- **Auto-fill Dates**: Invoice/payment dates auto-populate with today's date
- **Conditional Fields**: Date fields only show when status is active
- **Form Validation**: Proper date validation for API compatibility

## 📈 Data Flow

### Invoice Generation Process
1. **Filter Bookings**: `endDate` within period + `invoiced = false`
2. **Filter Expenses**: `date` within period + `billable = true` + `paid = false`
3. **Generate Invoice**: Calculate totals and display
4. **Mark as Invoiced**: Update booking status (manual process)

### Payment Tracking
1. **Record Expenses**: All expenses start as `paid = false`
2. **Track Payments**: Update `paid = true` + `paidDate` when paid
3. **Invoice Filtering**: Only unpaid expenses appear on invoices

## 🔧 Configuration

### Notification System
```typescript
// Usage throughout the app
const { notifySuccess, notifyError, notifyInfo } = useNotify()

notifySuccess('Operation completed successfully')
notifyError('Something went wrong')
notifyInfo('No data found')
```

### Filter Integration
```typescript
// API filters support
const filters = {
  invoiced: false,    // Booking invoice status
  paid: false,        // Expense payment status
  start_date: '2024-07-01',
  end_date: '2024-07-31'
}
```

## 📋 Migration Notes

### Database Changes
- All existing bookings: `invoiced = false`, `invoiceDate = null`
- All existing expenses: `paid = false`, `paidDate = null`
- Total uninvoiced bookings: 148
- Total unpaid expenses: 86 (₱86,236.88)

### Behavioral Changes
- **Invoice Logic**: Now uses check-out date instead of check-in date
- **Expense Inclusion**: Only unpaid expenses appear on invoices
- **Status Tracking**: Manual marking of invoiced/paid status required

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Bulk Operations**: Add bulk invoice/payment status updates
2. **Automated Marking**: Auto-mark items as invoiced when invoice is generated
3. **Reporting**: Add payment status reports and analytics
4. **Integration**: Connect with accounting systems for payment tracking
