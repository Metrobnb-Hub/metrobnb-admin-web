Expense Enhancements : Added pagination, date filtering, and improved UI to expenses page

Booking Page Separation : Separated booking data entry from booking list into dedicated pages

Files and Code Summary
components/partners/InvoiceGeneratorModal.vue : Complete invoice generator with partner/unit/date filtering, API integration, proper field mapping (camelCase), and billable expense filtering with pagination support

components/PartnerInvoice.vue : Print-ready invoice display component with pagination, fixed print CSS, and proper data structure handling

pages/expenses/index.vue : Completely rewritten with API-based filtering, pagination (20 items/page), date range filtering, proper partner/unit name display, and clean card-based layout

pages/admin/units.vue : Modernized with mobile-first design, card-based mobile view, desktop table view, enhanced search/filtering, and responsive layout

composables/api.ts : Updated getBookings() and getExpenses() to support start_date, end_date, billable, and type query parameters with pagination

types/api.ts : Enhanced ApiFilters interface with date range, billable, and type filtering parameters

components/expenses/EditExpenseModal.vue : Fixed to use data manager, handle field name compatibility, and support new capitalized expense types

pages/bookings/create.vue : New dedicated booking entry page with form and navigation

pages/accounting/bookings.vue : Updated to remove form section and add navigation to create page

Key Insights
API Structure : Backend returns data in camelCase format (guestName, startDate, baseAmount, etc.) not snake_case as initially expected

Invoice Filtering Logic : Bookings filtered by partner ID, unit ID (optional), and date range using startDate; expenses filtered same way plus billable=true only

Mobile-First Design Pattern : User prefers modern responsive designs with card layouts for mobile and table layouts for desktop

Print CSS Requirements : Browser print functionality requires specific CSS rules to hide headers/footers and preserve colors

Data Manager Usage : All components should use centralized data manager with .value access for reactive refs and proper array safety checks

API Pagination Limits : API has maximum limit of 100 records per request, requiring pagination handling for large datasets

Expense Type Enum : API expects capitalized expense types ('Cleaning', 'Laundry', 'Supplies', 'Wifi', 'Electricity', 'Repair', 'Repairs', 'Miscellaneous', 'Misc')

Data Integrity Issue : Kate's expense records have incorrect unit_id values pointing to Casa Aurea instead of Espasyo By Kate - this is a backend database issue requiring SQL fixes
